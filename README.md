## ⚠️ Disclaimers
### <ins> ***I should not be held responsible for the actions of anyone that uses this program.*** </ins>
#### This program was written as my attempt to understand, and show to others, how:
- HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses are formatted
- Security measures are implemented in HTTPS, with XSRF tokens (Cross Site Reference Forgery tokens) and JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)
- Sites interact with a client
- To send requests and get responses
- GET and POST request methods work
- Clients get a session-token (JWT) from the website
- JSON files are formatted, sent and recieved
#### It is not my intention for this program to be used as a way to "cheat" on Educake quizzes, but rather as an easy way to understand how websites, especially logins and submittals, truly work. What YOU do with this code is YOUR choice, not mine.
<br>

### <ins>***There is no 'hacking' or illegality in this program***</ins> 

#### This program does not edit Educake's servers, complete quizzes for you or perform any actions that could be deemed as 'hacking' in any way. All the answers stored on Educake are openly available to be accessed via their API, and this program merely bypasses the GUI to get the answers without logging questions as "incorrectly answered".
